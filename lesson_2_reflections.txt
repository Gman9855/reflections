What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You get a message "initialized empty git repository in..."  You need to do this to set up git so that it can track changes in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you place files you want to commit.
